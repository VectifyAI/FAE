(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct expertise to power movement from point A to point B.We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour  platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing  services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice  providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  \u201cend-user(s)\u201d  or\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks.We usethis same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight.Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fragmented markets.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis.Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.We calculate our ridesharingcategory position based on the best available data within a given region.For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products.We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics firms.Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe  world  where  we  operate.We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category position in its respective market.DeliveryOur  Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.We launchedour Delivery app over six years ago.We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network.For example, Deliveryenables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times.Delivery also expandsthe pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform.In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction.", "8d5f456d-5209-4668-a873-830026ae8a5d": "Theacquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup, Inc.

(\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough Transplace\u2019s  expertise  in transportation  management.The acquisition  of Transplace

Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Platform SynergiesOur PlatformThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers andcarriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies.Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep  technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.Ourtechnologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational ExcellenceOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships withcities and regulators.Product ExpertiseOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We  believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform users.Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users.For example,Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered.Webelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber.Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings.Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities as a subscription offering.Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers.We exited 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs.In 2020, we rolled out our\u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlockingcross-platform advertising formats.",

markets.We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize5", "a3bb3c9e-c61a-488c-8542-c125d468238a": "these industries.As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition.While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do.The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\u2022Mobility.Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services.In addition,public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.OurDelivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022Freight.Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H.Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Government RegulationWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment.Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and  regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation.These laws and regulations areconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business.Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are described below.MobilityOur  platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.A large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements.Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and  regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexities for our business and operating model.Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities  in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation NetworkCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations.These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.", "2cd9ef8c-8702-47e2-8135-cf34e42ad603": "For example, California\u2019s AssemblyBill  5  (\u201cAB5\u201d),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.The  CaliforniaAttorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,  and sought an injunction  and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged  misclassification  of drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith the provisions of Proposition 22.See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A and \u201cNote 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to ourconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.6", "58d065d6-cba4-4faa-83b2-ebcee50a779a": "In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business.For example:\u2022In London, Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal.In November2019,  TfL  declined  to  issue  us  a  license,  finding  that  we  were  not  \u201cfit  and  proper,\u201d  including  with  respect  to  confidence  in  our  change  and  releasemanagement processes.We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\u2022Since April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing  requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices.Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\u2022In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers.In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services.In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform.As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour  platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.Similar legislativeor regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significantcomplexities for our business and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and ProtectionOur  technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  ourcompliance  with  laws  dealing  with  the  collection  and  processing  of  personal  data  is  core  to  our  strategy  to  improve  platform  user  experience  and  build  trust.Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing ofpersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties.Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a lawwhich went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor  covered  businesses.", "d7e40570-5184-43fd-94e4-ed33f9b5ae5f": "U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  ofpersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial ServicesMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the\u201cEEA\u201d).Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such lawscould affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform.We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.AntitrustCompetition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7", "f6faf802-d15b-43c5-94ee-4034360b4ad0": "the  EU,  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and  India,  particularly  surrounding  issues  of  predatory  pricing,  price-fixing,  and  abuse  of  market  power.In  addition,governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significantfines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations onour contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual PropertyWe  believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.Ourintellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability  to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.We  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existingofferings  and  services,  and  to  expand  the  range  of  our  offerings  through  research  and  development  (\u201cR&D\u201d)  and  acquisition  of  third-party  businesses  andtechnology.SeasonalityMobilityWe typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typicallygenerate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America andEurope.We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter.In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19  pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pandemic continues.DeliveryWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at UberEmployeesWe  are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately  72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.Our  human  capital  strategies  are  developed  and  managed  by  our  Chief  PeopleOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Adapting  to  a  New  Way  of  Working.In  2021,  the  ever-evolving  COVID-19  pandemic  continued  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  employees  and  ourworkforce management strategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work.As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able todo so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans\u2014althoughmany of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date.", "297fe36d-93c1-4fb2-8a7f-ec216c100653": "Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced newdynamics into the households of many of our employees.As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stressand  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.The  issues  of  stress  and  balance  were  particularly  exacerbated  among  caregivers  of  youngchildren.To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigatedthis crisis in their personal and professional lives.We provided8", "bb2bf8e9-b010-49d9-9145-d2ba3e221288": "more attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.Employee Engagement.To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability.We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveysand related  tools.We historically  conducted a semi-annual  workforce  survey that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and well-being.But in2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month.We use the results ofthese regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth opportunities.For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased on employee feedback.In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee  Development  and  Retention.We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough internal mobility programs.Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem to have an impact on other areas of the business.Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness  and  productivity.This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life\u2019s  expected  and  unexpected  events.Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefitspackages to our employees and their families.We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, futureattrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our2021 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website.The information in the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.Diversity and InclusionWe  believe  that  great  minds  don\u2019t  think  alike,  and  we  work  hard  to  ensure  that  people  of  diverse  backgrounds  feel  welcome  and  valued.We  encouragedifferent  opinions  and  approaches  to  be  heard,  and  then  we  come  together  and  build.We  believe  that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows.To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implementprocesses throughout Uber and measure progress.For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically underrepresented groups.Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior executives.We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline.As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially.To dothat, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.In July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.Some of our commitments to anti-racism include:\u2022Ridding our platform of racism\u2022Fighting racism with technology\u2022Sustaining equity and belonging for all\u2022Driving equity in the communityFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture

Well-BeingIn  addition  to  employees  discussed  above,  our  business  also  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  and  engage  Drivers,  consumers,  Merchants,  shippers,  andCouriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.In  relation  to  those  individuals  who  earn  income  on  our  platform,  Uber  is  one  of  the  largest  open  platforms  for  work  in  the  world,  providing  accessible,flexible work in approximately 72 countries.Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created9", "68cab569-7429-43dc-aae9-f7dcfb3e7ffa": "through its apps.A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employment.We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-based work.Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,  flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers.However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportunities.Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy compared with those that employees receive.The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.This does not have to be the case.AtUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work.Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.We believe all workshould be treated equally.We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net.This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app.Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6In  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6In California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward.Pursuant tothis change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible.We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022Protections and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022Earnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022Progression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their family members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\u2022Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform.We believe thatthe best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our

business  restrictions,  school  closures,limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, forexample, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand.Even as such restrictions are being lifted andmany regions around the world

applicable privacy, consumer protection and other legal and regulatoryrequirements,  as  well  as  the  latest  guidance  from  regulatory  authorities  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  may  be  subject  to  legal  or  regulatorychallenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments.In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features,or  health  and  safety  requirements  in  response  to  COVID-19  may  heighten  other  risks  described  in  this  \u201cRisk  Factors\u201d  section,  including  our  classification  ofDrivers.These challenges could result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts.In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users\u2019  behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.Moreover,  even  after  shelter  at  home  orders  and  travel  advisories  are  lifted,demand for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels.In addition, we cannot predict  the impact  the COVID-19 pandemic  will have on our business partners  and third-party  vendors, and we may be adverselyimpacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer.Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets.", "94933ef1-511b-400c-9de7-96dfedd9eb46": "To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the otherrisks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.Operational RisksOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.The  classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.We  areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform.Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13", "c9d7b660-d03f-49fa-98c1-396c3770baf6": "expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims.We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021.Furthermore, we areinvolved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condition.Changes to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions.For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020.Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.InAugust 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe  pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent work.Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions.For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction.If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions.If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices.Additionally, we may not haveadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof the Drivers currently using our platform.Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another  example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.ruling  by  theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan self-employed).Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, goingforward.", "bad3aa5c-6fc4-405b-aa7f-679e5cf2ee25": "Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan.Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme  Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In  addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations.For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union.If a significant number ofDrivers  were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting  Estimates\u201d  included  in  Part II,  Item  7  of this  Annual  Report on  Form  10-K and  Note  1 in  the  section  titled  \u201cNotes  to  the Consolidated

competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, lowbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries.We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly fragmented.We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto entry that characterize these industries.In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low.Consumers have a propensity toshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan  we  do.As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products.Increased competitioncould result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.We face competition in each of our offerings, including:\u2022Mobility.Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services.Inaddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany cities.We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.Our Delivery offering competes  with numerous companies  in the meal, grocery and other delivery  space in various regions for Drivers,consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.Our  Delivery  offering  also  competes  with  restaurants,  including  those  that  offer  their  own  delivery  and/or  take-away,  meal  kit  delivery  services,grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022Freight.Our  Freight  offering  competes  with  global  and  North  American  freight  brokers  such  as  C.H.Robinson,  Total  Quality  Logistics,  XPOLogistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Many of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products andofferings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer.Further, some of our current or potential competitorshave, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographicmarket.In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operatinghistories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes.", "d836fe0a-de2d-4b86-a789-f02f14c52047": "As a result, such

not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummatethem only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained.Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all orpart of our or the target company\u2019s operations or agree to other remedies.Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.Our inability to compete effectively wouldhave an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, andmay continue to  offer,  significant  Driver incentives  and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely  affected  and may  continue to adverselyaffect our financial performance.To remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or servicefees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.At times, in certain geographic markets,we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip.In certain geographic markets andregions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions.We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions will be successful.Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance.Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction.We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers.For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application.If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill  continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.Moreover,  certain  of  our  stockholders,  including  SoftBank  (a  large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe future.These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete moreeffectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,  shippers,  and  carriers  to  their  platform  and  away  from  ours.Such  competitive  pressures  may  lead  us  to  maintain  or  lower  fares  or  service  fees  ormaintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relativelynascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception.We incurred operating losses of $8.6 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion.We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levelsand decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, wemay not be able to maintain or increase profitability.", "bb10bbfd-9af2-4b1a-95ac-9ce71129e7e4": "We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses,as we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hireadditional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform.These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed inincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses.Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increaserevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability.In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect toadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate.Further, we charge a lowerservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in anegative  take  rate  with  respect  to  those  transactions  after  considering  amounts  collected  from  consumers  and  paid  to  Drivers.As  we  expand  our  offerings  toadditional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate.As such, we may not be able to achieve ormaintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all.Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect toachieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant

or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.Our  success  in  a  given  geographic  market  significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  our  network  scale  and  liquidity  in  that  geographicmarket by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform.If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect to offer them through a competitor\u2019s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform.We haveexperienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that market.Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform.Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill become less appealing to consumers and merchants.A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups  and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners.If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform.An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.Although we maybenefit from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby smaller competitors.Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore important  to service  quality than the absolute size of the network.If our service  quality diminishes  or our competitors\u2019  products achieve  greater  marketadoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.Our number of

shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Driversand merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,including  as  a result  of safety  incidents  and  corporate  reporting  related  to  safety,  perceived  political  or  geopolitical  affiliations,  a pandemic  or an  outbreak  ofdisease or similar public health concern, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers,

dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will

States.Such protests have resulted, and any future protestsmay result, in interruptions to our business.Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users,

been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate.With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries  through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible

screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient  manner,  which  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming.Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges  to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired

have  previously  received  significant  media  coverage  andnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintainor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.Maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  ability  to  attract  new  employees  and  platform  users,  to  preserve  and  deepen  theengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverseplatform user sentiment.We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust of our company.Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult  for  us  to

litigation and governmental investigations.Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on our platform in the United States.The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of

misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives.Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay not be successful.Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions.Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and operations

ofDecember 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States.We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally.Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology.If our newhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff,

inworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin  workforce.Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee

bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle.For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries.In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need to share, navigate, and

demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiativeswill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It isalso possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete.

licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe  number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform.These minimum rates took effect in February 2019.Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future.Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco.This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices on our platform.Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban  and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport.As a result of this concentration, ouroperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom airports.", "a95948d9-46ce-4bbf-98ad-5061952625e6": "Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility  and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating  that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing operations altogether.Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite permits.Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or Drivers.Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.While wehave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airports in all jurisdictions.If  we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing24", "de6b97f1-406f-41ce-824f-191400b91846": "network.We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles present substantial opportunities.Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects.For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers on our platform.If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities.Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened.Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing.Theseregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform.If regulations of this nature are implemented,we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all.Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic.A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office.Prolonged remotework, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee turnover.", "dd0a02b3-099d-4fac-8d6d-7cb5e5f69ade": "The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi.We haveentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans.We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears of industry experience.If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely affected.To attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures.These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnelwe require to operate our business effectively.Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,25", "423b47c5-93bf-4463-930d-e7fd3c2b29c6": "retain,  and  motivate  employees  may  not  be  as  effective  as  in  the  past,  particularly  if  the  value  of  the  underlying  stock  does  not  increase  commensurate  withexpectations  or  consistent  with  our  historical  stock  price  growth.If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending.Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,  taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases.Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses.Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering.If spending atmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results.Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,  factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt.Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the control of these parties.In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek alternative sources of income.Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson our platform to decline.A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and operating results.If we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.As such, we are anattractive target of data security attacks by third parties.Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,alteration or destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation andbrand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business.",

prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizableuntil launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures.Our servers and platform may bevulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect.Individuals able to circumvent our security measuresmay  misappropriate  confidential,  proprietary,  or  personal  information  held  by  or  on  behalf  of  us,  disrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  computers,  or  otherwisedamage our business.In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,including potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.Security breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmentalinvestigation.We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future.For example, in May 2014, we experienced a datasecurity incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that anemployee had unintentionally posted publicly on a26", "f2c988dd-d33b-4c1f-be47-a76ac9ec6b5d": "code-sharing  website  used  by  software  developers  (the  \u201c2014  Breach\u201d).In  October  and  November  of

could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy anddata  protection  practices,\u201d  below.As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.Forexample, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018.If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity  breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant liabilities.If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors.Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.Moreover, any suchnew  or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.For  example,  some  productchanges  in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform.If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our operating results.We  track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation  provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.", "7ae3be6a-58e5-4b4e-b82d-898245a5f3b1": "Certain  of  our  operational  metrics  are  subject  toinherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.We track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems andtools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by anythird party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions onwhich we rely.Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position.If the internal systems and toolswe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate.Whilethese numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring  how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior.In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies.If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations ofour business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to beaccurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial resultscould be adversely affected.In certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, andsafety concerns.If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global27", "7baf3a73-700b-41ed-9374-d4fd11a9e432": "Gross  Bookings.This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns.For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing.Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions.In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other criminal acts.In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing our platform have been reported.If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our business.In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips.We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers.Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us.Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws.If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation.Suchcollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card.As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit our business model.We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d).The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures.Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards.Under certain circumstances specified in the payment cardnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard.Such activities mayreveal  that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts.In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating  rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.In  addition  toviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives  from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.The  loss  of  our  credit  card  acceptance  privileges  for  any  one  of  thesereasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,and operating

telecommunications  network  operators  to  provide  us  with  the  bandwidth  we  need  to  provide  our  products  andofferings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform.If our platform is unavailable when platform users attemptto access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, andmay use our competitors\u2019 products or offerings more often.In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunicationsoperators.If  mobile  Internet  access  fees  or  other  charges  to  Internet  users  increase,  consumer  traffic  may  decrease,  which  may  in  turn  cause  our  revenue

as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.We currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in servicesfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.We use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located

misconduct.These facilities  may also bevulnerable  to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  and  similar  events.Oursystems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party serviceproviders to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or requireus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service.This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand.We may not be able to easily switchto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference  to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks.Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilitieshave no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities oncommercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center isarranged.Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their servicesthrough  our  platform,  and  reduce  use  of  our  platform  by  consumers  and  shippers.Our  business  and  operating  results  may  be  harmed  if  current  and  potentialDrivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe our platform is unreliable.In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computationalcapacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,which would have an

we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,and  any  new  equity  securities  we  issue  may  have  rights,  preferences,  and  privileges  superior  to  those  of  existing  stockholders.Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities.For example, ourexisting debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness.We may not be able to obtain additional financingon favorable terms, if at all.If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness.Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As of December 31, 2021, we

attractive terms or at all.We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness.Such payments willreduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing forworking capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise.We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or to fund our operations.To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating

differently by different companies.For example, wemay become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions.Like many othermultinational  corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax

taxes.Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowedto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions.These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those mattersare being litigated.This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subjectto such taxes; even when such payments32", "a00065a7-46ef-441a-8d14-25be4c50eb48": "are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously.If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collectingthe payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies forvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results.Furthermore, our futureincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions  that have higher  statutory  tax rates,  changes in the valuation  allowance  on our U.S. and Netherlands'  deferred  tax assets, or changes  in tax laws,regulations, or accounting principles.We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad.Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition and operating results.In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain.The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.Ourtax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which  could  impact  our  financial  position.In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses and arrangements.Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations.The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear  in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.Inaddition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.We couldbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions.New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business.", "76965e4b-c70d-4adc-9ffc-ab977c7299e0": "As a result of the large and expandingscale of our

amounts generated prior to January1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022.As of December 31, 2021,we

taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome  tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC, if  a  corporationundergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by

diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We  may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable  cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing

functions.For example,with respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and34", "d3fffd0f-858d-416c-bb15-fb7f6039f39e": "payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber\u2019s apps and each company\u2019s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operateindependently and report to such company\u2019s own Chief Executive Officer.Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.In addition, our acquisition  of Careem  has increased  our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices  Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar  laws outside theUnited States.Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will beaccretive  to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce  could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness.Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.In certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation.In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit.For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal.In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes.We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.Two new conditions(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes.Anyinability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,  and  operating  results.We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit.Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity\u2019s  Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition  on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services.Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject.", "2ea1cb58-c641-4638-bed8-7d291f5aa9bc": "For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only.In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.These minimum rates took effect in February 2019.Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future.In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion.InAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020.Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.Inaddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United States.If other35", "99e83a32-13ed-4147-acfb-4b000ea85012": "jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.In certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or thatwe believe are invalid or inapplicable.In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant.For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance.We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions.However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong.As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat  we  violated  local  competition  laws.In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia.Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations.Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities.Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed.Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform.In many instances, we make the business decisionas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely affect our revenue.In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications.In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing with respect to our Mobility offering.We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions.To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings.A large number of proposals are before various national,regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users.We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform.For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medicaltransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations.", "ff0fbdc4-d9e7-4fd0-b0fd-b3528e828f33": "Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform.We are activelychallenging  some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices.Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or emissions may impact our business.For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto electric vehicles by 2025.Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023.Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide.Our failure to share such data in accordancewith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt oneither a temporary or indefinite basis.Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly36", "7e989b6e-696f-4b35-96aa-2f6d6f38a54e": "referred to as Brexit.The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate.We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business.Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers, including Drivers and consumers.These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,  among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability, discrimination, safety, and employment.For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017.The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and operating results.In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app.We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings.For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof anti-competitive conduct.For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both.If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.In  addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose significant  fines or penalties,  require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions  that limit or require  us to modify our operations,including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.", "27576662-0574-4d92-a57f-552cc8d79dd8": "Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating results.We expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC.Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain  aspects  of our business are  subject to these laws and could require  us to obtain licenses  to continue  to operate  in such jurisdictions.For example,  oursubsidiary  in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,  as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.In  addition,  UberPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA.Wecontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and supportthe future growth of our business.We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our businessoperations before being granted such licenses.If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease orlimit business37", "dd0cb784-e28c-4b07-b1e3-98b75af9a4b7": "operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action,or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses.In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa  payment  services  provider.Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers, merchants, shippers or carriers.Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements.In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction.These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and  prospects.Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived  by those users.A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In  addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith  changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business.EffectiveJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulations.In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission, online payments, and financial regulation.These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or other enforcement actions.Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.Further, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and payments to sanctioned parties.", "ca53c4de-84dc-4e6c-8b22-bd2677ea05ca": "We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand  sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government  authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and otherU.S.and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.We  are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies, including state AG offices in the United States and abroad.Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded.We have in the past and may in the future,settle claims related to such matters.For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour failure to report the incident for approximately one year.In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018.In November and December2018, U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach.The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators.As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued aproposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport.We negotiated the total payment to $9.1538", "5834ff3a-bca9-47da-8db6-c52f15daf616": "million ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021.Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.We are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries.These  government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions.Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational  harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations.Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international  privacy, data protection, and other laws.Suchviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability.Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved.In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect consumer information through 2038.In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future failure to report security incidents.In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6 million.We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies.In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices.In September 2018, we entered into stipulatedjudgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,enforcement  actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations.For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14, 2018.If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This  risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security.The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018.The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers and processors of personal data.", "b96ac926-59f8-4239-9f44-ec473fb733ce": "Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal  data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data

providers  that  may  process  personal  data.TheGDPR  further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual decision-making.Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition.Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance.For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020.The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.Other U.S.states  have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.Brazilprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)39", "fafdfeda-8ebb-4076-8c75-1b3b7828123b": "passed in California in November 2020.Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata outside the EEA.We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses.Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor obtaining or maintaining  a license  or otherwise, from law enforcement  agencies,  and from intelligence  agencies.This disclosure  may result in a failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand.In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership.We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem\u2019s  app  on  either  atemporary or indefinite basis.Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions.This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent.Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs.Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others.We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound liable, significant damages.Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others.We aresubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers\u2019 tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices.The results of any suchlitigation,  investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,  costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.", "a1dfa17f-8a8e-4781-a528-e07c7b805958": "If  any  of  these  legalproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court.However, arbitration maybecome more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome.Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny.To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour  litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform users and employees.Further,  with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection.If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40", "0da8c645-b75c-4606-8b00-4b2ef964f6d6": "We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.We are subject to the FCPAand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional  compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness partners  in violation  of various  anti-corruption  laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties  are often outside our control.Ouracquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar  with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions.However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company.Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations.In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours.If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense.In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers  may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages.In addition, in early 2017,we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs.Inconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress.These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,  and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business.", "8d31a5a0-8ced-4f49-b21e-59d425286944": "If insurancecarriers change the terms  of such insurance in a manner not favorable  to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.Insurance related toour Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers.We rely on alimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all.In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile  insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability.If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase.The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada than in other geographies.Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41", "18ac3c10-a93f-4ec8-9bbd-c093e044b7c2": "transfer a significant portion of the risk from the

condition.Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms.Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves.We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse  our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight.As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face.Even if these claims donot result  in  liability,  we could incur  significant  costs in investigating  and defending  against  them.If insurers  become  insolvent,  they may not be  able  to payotherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all.If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may besubject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  relating  to  insurance  coverage  which  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental  entities  or  others.Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.Further, serviceproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus.Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others.These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings.Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions.For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject  of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.In addition, an increasing number ofmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering.",

our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.The efforts we have taken and

sued, and mayin the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation.If a company we acquire or in which we havean interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investmentmay materially decline.Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management\u2019sattention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated

China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act.While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment  company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse effect on our financial condition.To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements of the Investment Company

indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress themarket price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.We may issue our shares of commonstock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investmentsor otherwise.For example, on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates for aggregate consideration of approximately 70 million shares of ourcommon stock and equity awards covering approximately 13 million shares of our common stock.This and any other such issuance, including the issuance ofadditional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the tradingprice of our common stock to decline.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock.We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansionof our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments includerestrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.As a result, you may only receive a return on your

to the extent enforceable, the federaldistrict courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit ourstockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the followingtypes of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\u2022any derivative action or proceeding

being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failureto maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, theeffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof  our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion.As our business continues to grow in sizeand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company.During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls.Any failure to maintaininternal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.If  we  are  unable  toconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor other regulatory authorities.Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF

ActionIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf ofcertain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries.The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia.Theclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain taxi licenses.In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim.We denythese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal ProceedingsWhile  it is not possible to determine  the outcome  of the legal  actions,  investigations,  and proceedings  brought against  us, we believe  that,  except for thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial

laws than we are in the United States.Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such

We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providersof ride services and merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers withpublic transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freightindustry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.48", "133aaf91-5162-4642-a1be-c75d27dff7d7": "COVID-19In  March  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization  declared  the  outbreak  of  coronavirus  (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d)  a  pandemic.The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial  position,  and  cash  flows.Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities\u2019  and  states\u2019declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response InitiativesWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe.We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs.The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings.We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings.Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.As  vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability.During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.While we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions  that  may be taken  by governmental  authorities,  the further  impact  on the business of Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and business partners,  and otherfactors identified in Part I, Item 1A.\u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification DevelopmentsThe  classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.We  areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work.Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.", "f2fac3b1-a9b2-49c5-bb9e-3646daa7e76c": "Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied.The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition 22 is unconstitutional.On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financial position, or cash flows.Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against usasserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent49", "2e8016fd-776f-4a08-9777-7bca34b312df": "contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors.The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016.The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018.We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme  Court of the UK upheld the tribunal  ruling.Subsequently, we initiated  a historical  claims  settlement  process for UKdrivers.Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage.Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber.They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan.We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.The pension regulator hasconfirmed  that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions  unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our  portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers.Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and  we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.",

Delivery Gross Bookings grew66% from 2020, on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related toCOVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international markets.

Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These  activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce.

MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform  in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  oftransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We  define  Trips  as  the  number  of  completed  consumer  Mobility  or  New  Mobility  rides  and  Delivery  orders  in  a  given  period.  For  example,  anUberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe thatTrips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n60", "cd752bf9-ecae-476f-a80f-2c2f56152c2a": "Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility and New Mobility rides;Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives; and Freight revenue.Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers.

In addition to revenue, net income(loss),  income  (loss)  from  operations,  and  other  results  under  GAAP,  we  use  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  revenue  growth  rates  in  constant  currency,  which  aredescribed below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management toevaluate  our  operating  performance.  Accordingly,  we  believe  that  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  useful  information  to  investors  and  others  inunderstanding  and  evaluating  our  operating  results  in  the  same  manner  as  our  management  team  and  board  of  directors.  Our  calculation  of  these  non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measuresshould not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted EBITDAWe  define  Adjusted  EBITDA

operatingperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses.Accordingly, we believe that AdjustedEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management teamand board of directors.In addition, it provides a useful measure for

support  those  whose  earning  opportunities  have  been  depressed  as  a  result  of  COVID-19, as  well  as  communities  hit  hard  by  the  pandemic,  we  haveannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost ofpersonal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to freerides  and  food  deliveries  to  healthcare  workers,  seniors,  and  others  in  need  as  well  as

policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen  used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements.We have based our estimates on historical experience andon  various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64", "4d6f8ed2-c229-416a-aaec-d99c8e899396": "We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more

platform in connection with our Mobility products andDelivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).Wehave concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.As such,uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.Incentives provided tocustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived.Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification of these incentives.End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair values.The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Suchvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,  actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired  finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset to goodwill.Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.",

with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPOdates to the valuation date.The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.The discount rate is updated during eachperiod to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.Upon closing of the IPO in May 2019,

the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which wedo not have a controlling interest or significant influence.Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.This valuation requiresjudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.In determining the estimatedfair  value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities.In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment.The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.If anequity  investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated statement of operations.Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized cost.In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof the security\u2019s amortized cost.In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.The factorsconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome (loss), net of tax.Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.", "cf304c08-5c8c-47a4-8c11-58f3ae047398": "Subsequently, werecognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 netincome or loss, and the amortization of basis differences.In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter inarrears.Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings.We  review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying

trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors.If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determinedand an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.The fair value determination, particularly forinvestments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and66",

impairmentcharges.Goodwill Impairment AssessmentWe  review  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  (in  the  fourth  quarter)  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  goodwill  might  beimpaired.We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carryingvalues for each of our reporting units.Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers reviewfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affectingthe reporting unit.To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.Performing  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions.These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss ContingenciesWe  are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations,  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.We record a liability whenwe believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  ofnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and theestimated amount of loss.These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to changebased on new information and future events.The outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reportingperiod in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income TaxesWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  jurisdictions.We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.Theestablishment  of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  todetermine the fair value of such intangible assets.Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates.The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal andexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of suchassumptions, estimates or actual results.We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will besustained upon examination.Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require makingjudgments, assumptions, and estimates.", "c1cfb977-e2b6-4552-8675-6f35294d44b0": "While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final taxoutcome of these matters will not be different.We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.To theextent that the final tax outcome of these matters  is different  than the amounts recorded,  such differences  may impact the provision for income taxes and theeffective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.In addition,we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.We regularlyassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67", "a47c584b-4b76-41b9-b3a9-b7ea7d180142": "Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance  mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential  liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation.The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported as of the balance sheet date.The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss  experience.In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known.Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance claim settlement process.Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.Actual resultsdepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and social environments.As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour board of directors and non-employees.The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees.The majority of our outstandingRSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition.A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition.The service-based vesting condition for themajority of these awards is satisfied over four years.The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics.The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.We accountfor forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date.The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022Expected term.We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\u2022Risk-free interest rate.The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\u2022Expected volatility.We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term.Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\u2022Expected dividend yield.Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We  continue  to  use  judgment  in  evaluating  the  expected  volatility  and  expected  term  utilized  in  our  stock-based  compensation  expense  calculation  on  aprospective basis.", "83e49beb-7e5f-4478-86f6-85f8b0e78353": "As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expectedterm, which could materially impact our future stock-based

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.Investment RiskOur  investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69", "d5885047-d8a2-4893-ac0c-2c93dbfc19fc": "ITEM 8.

company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71",

ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent  in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers.For the yearended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions.These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor  losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied to historical claim and loss experience.In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss developmentpatterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.", "e5fb46d2-09d8-43cd-836c-f1f54d15e7e8": "These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed

Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.Uber isa technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).Uber connectsconsumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother delivery services.Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks.Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d).We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions whichmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances.On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities.These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could differ from those estimates.We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets.The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit risk concentration.Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial  issuer.Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented.", "0f411002-4ad3-49eb-8baf-6dc0c1d7c7b9": "Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.We rely on alimited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.Payment serviceproviders are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality.No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe  have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.Our  operations  havehistorically been funded through equity and debt financings.While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolvingcredit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able toobtain additional82",

adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility  offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows.The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and  cash equivalents  consist  of  cash held  in checking  and savings  accounts  as  well as  investments  in  money market  funds, commercial  paper,  U.S.government  and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.We  consider  all  highly-liquid  investments  purchased  with  an  original  or  remaining  maturity  of  threemonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, whichare included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies andalso include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.Restricted cash and cash equivalents areclassified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction.The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalentsand restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements

upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to oneof our subsidiaries.As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under theindemnification agreements for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet.Accordingly, the amount withdrawn ispresented as collateral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.During the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented ascollateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held.Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer tonon-current restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Legacy Auto Insurance TransferOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement(the \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James River

our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in theamount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d).Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risktransfer arrangements.In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator forongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense.The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021,and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities.During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidatedstatement of

service providers but not yet remitted to us, or (ii)completed shipments where we invoice Freight customers (\u201cShippers\u201d) and payment has not been received. The timing of settlement of amounts due from theseparties varies by region and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.Refer to Note 10 \u2013 Supplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.Although  we  pre-authorize  forms  of  payment  to  mitigate  our  exposure,  we  bear  the  cost  of  any  accounts  receivable  losses.  We  record  an  allowance  fordoubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as costof revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographicaltrends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card losses were$195 million, $178 million and $246 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.Property and Equipment, NetProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight\u2011linemethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:Property and EquipmentEstimated Useful LifeLandIndefiniteBuildings30-45 yearsSite improvements5-15 yearsLeased vehicles3-10 yearsComputer equipment3-5 yearsFurniture and fixtures3-5 yearsDockless e-bikes3 yearsInternal-use software2 yearsLeased computer equipmentShorter of estimated useful life or lease termLeasehold improvementsShorter of estimated useful life or lease termWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain orloss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset\u2019s useful life arecharged to operating expenses as incurred.We capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completedand the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and beginsonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed asincurred. In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for saleas of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd. (\u201cWaydrive\u201d) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd.(\u201cLCR\u201d), a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in Singapore.

842, \u201cLeases\u201d (\u201cASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition methodand used the effective date as the date of initial application.We elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset  which  we  do  not  own.Right  of  use  (\u201cROU\u201d)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received.Lease liabilitiesare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date.The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease  payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.The  IBR  is  ahypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments  or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs.Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance sheets.Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance sheets.For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term.For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.As of December31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.AcquisitionsWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d).Thepurchase  price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition date.The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.Upon the conclusionof the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolidated statements of operations.Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected to benefit from the business combination.We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.", "c31e3403-ec45-4e10-856d-b82521440f4f": "In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.If, afterassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impairment testing is not required.However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary.However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.Refer to Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill andIntangible Assets for further information.Intangible Assets, NetIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 18 years.We

security and the type of investment.Our marketable equity securities inpublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.Certain investmentsin  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment.We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators.Impairment indicators might include,but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or  a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.If  animpairment  exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment.We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt SecuritiesAccounting  for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.Investments in debt securities are  classified as available-for-sale and are  initially recorded at  fair  value.Investments in marketable debt securitiesinclude commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds.As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities.Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale debt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe  account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (\u201cASC  326\u201d).Weadopted  ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).In circumstanceswhere we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized  cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security\u2019s  amortized  cost.Incircumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.", "ccf65ed9-f299-4b6e-b032-8f83d4a42883": "The factors considered in determining whether acredit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings actions, as well as other factors.To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net income (loss).Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.Improvements inexpected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.Investments accounted forunder the equity method are initially recorded at cost.Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to theinvestment balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences.We record our share of the results ofequity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.Weevaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value of the

inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable.We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount  of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date.In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value.The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservable inputs.The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our  primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,  accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.Refer  to Note 3 \u2013Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.If we determine that anentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial  statements.The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and (2)  has  the obligation  to  absorb losses  or  the right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially be significant to the VIE.Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether we are still the primary beneficiary.If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue RecognitionWe  recognize  revenue  when  or  as  we  satisfy  our  obligations.", "152c2b61-90a1-4573-b594-9a7b06e6178f": "We  derive  our  revenues  principally  from  Drivers\u2019  and  Merchants\u2019  use  of  our  platform,  on-demand lead generation,  and related  services,  including facilitating  payments from

Service\u201d).Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we alsogenerate revenue from end-users.We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.Additionally, we derive revenue fromcustomers' use of Freight services.We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87", "8a4c8270-4808-4550-a8ae-c0cc58a4ce96": "Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers and Merchants for each transaction.Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace.We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those markets.We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions.For the year endedDecember  31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users.As a result, thisclass of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs.Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.We evaluate the presentationof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e.\u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e.\u201cnet\u201d).This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For the majority  of Mobility and Delivery transactions,  our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants  to facilitate  a successful  trip orDelivery service to end-users.We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.We are not primarily responsiblefor Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling the services provided to end-users.In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting  end-users seeking Mobility and Deliveryservices with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users.", "9ab845e9-e271-4d36-81be-7e6af3f68d52": "Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice to Drivers and Merchants.In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery  services.In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the services.MobilityWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platform.We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an end-user

ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction.We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of a trip.88", "2f292ca4-88af-42da-8cb9-69b60d41bfc0": "In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers.We generally collect ourservice fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods.As wecurrently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidatedfinancial statements until collected from Drivers.Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.DeliveryWe  derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of  the  platform  and  related  service  to  successfullycomplete a meal delivery service on the platform.In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as wellas select other goods.We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price.The service fee paid by Couriers is the differencebetween the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers.End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while wepay Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery.Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction.Wetypically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.FreightWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment  by  the  Shipper.We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper\u2019s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent freight carriers.We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod of time a shipment is in transit.While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material.Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation ManagementWe  provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services.Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis.The majority of our

or agent in transactions with Shippers.For each contract entered into with a Shipper wherewe are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to theShipper.We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrierthat meets the Shipper's specifications.We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.Accordingly,

and E-ScootersPrior to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, whichwere derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842.New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d).Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip.We wereresponsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use.We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration RevenueIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology.Under thiscollaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term.We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue.Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to CustomersIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue  of  the  good  or  service  received.Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive.Sinceincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs.Weexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.We apply the practical expedient underASC  340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.The  amountrecorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received.Fair value of the service is establishedusing amounts paid to vendors for similar services.The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immaterial.In  some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising RevenueWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks.Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform.These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:Targeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon.An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries  during a limited  time period.We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers  as sales and marketingexpenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform.These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referringend-user.These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform.",

all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.This also includes any discounts offered under oursubscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.90", "3620f084-ca36-4b18-831b-83921e404bb8": "RefundsWe record refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants as a reduction of revenue.Refunds to end-users due to

from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities.Accordingly, such amounts are not includedas a component of revenue or cost of revenue.Practical ExpedientsWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contractswith an original expected length of one year or less.We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.Stock-Based CompensationWe  account  for  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of  GAAP,  which  requirescompensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.We account for forfeitures when theyoccur.The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,using appropriate valuation techniques.Service-Based AwardsWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSU(s)\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the requisiteservice period, which is generally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,typically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interestrates.We  estimate  the  volatility  of  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  based  on  the  weighted-average  historical  stock  price  volatility  of  our  own  shares  orcomparable publicly traded companies in our industry group.The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant witha term equal to the expected term.We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201doptions, as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.We estimate the expectedterm  for  non-employees\u2019  options  based  on  the  contractual  term.U.S.The  expected  dividend  yield  is  0.0%  as  we  have  not  paid  and  do  not  anticipate  payingdividends on our common stock.Performance-Based AwardsWe have granted restricted common stock awards (\u201cRSA(s)\u201d), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR(s)\u201d), stock options, and warrants that vest upon thesatisfaction  of  both  service-based  and  performance-based  conditions.The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.Theperformance-based  conditions  generally  are  satisfied  upon  achieving  specified  performance  targets,  such  as  our  financial  or  operating  metrics,  and/or  theoccurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial publicoffering  (\u201cIPO\u201d).We  record  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  performance-based  equity  awards  such  as  RSAs,  RSUs,  SARs,  and  stock  options  on  anaccelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable tobe satisfied.Prior  to  our IPO in  May  2019,  we had  not  recognized  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  awards  with  performance-based  conditions  which  include  aqualifying event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable.Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulativeone-time stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values.Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is recorded over the remaining requisite service period.", "1500b0cc-c3ed-4474-a1c1-5b4d3164f2b3": "Refer to Note 11 \u2013 Stockholders' Equity for

specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards.The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage.We estimate thevolatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in itsindustry group.We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios.The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe time of grant.Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period.The ESPP provides fortwelve-month  offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date.We estimatethe  fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.In  2019,  wedetermine volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour peer group.In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility.We estimatethe expected term based on the contractual term.Common Stock Fair ValueSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based  compensation  expense.We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.Thesecontemporaneous  third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits.", "efdf8662-ae47-4814-96bc-f7915fd8fdfe": "Income tax positions must

more-likely-than-not expected to be realized basedon the weighting of positive and negative evidence.Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of theappropriate  character  (for  example,  ordinary  income  or  capital  gain)  within  the  carryback  or  carryforward  periods  available  under  the  applicable  tax  law.Weregularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversalsof existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future marketconditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies.Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in92",

intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions todetermine the fair value of such intangible assets.Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates.The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although we

headcount,  exiting  a  market  or  consolidation  of  facilities  arerecognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including

adjustments  are  recorded  within  accumulated  othercomprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common StockholdersWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities.The two-class method requires income available tocommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as ifall income for the period had been distributed.Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities.We consider restricted common stockand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitabledividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.Prior  to  conversion  to  common  stock  upon  our  IPO,  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would  have  been  entitled  to  dividends  inpreference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared.Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restrictedcommon  stock,  common  stock  issued  upon  early  exercise  of  stock  options,  and  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  on  a  pro-rata  basisassuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock.These participating securities did not

captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential  liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation.The  insurance  reserves  is  the  liability  for  unpaid  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses,  which  represents  the  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaidobligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of thebalance sheet date.The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.Inaddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends,severity trends, and relevant industry data.These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.Reserve amounts estimated to be settledwithin one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balancesheets.While

Level  1  instrument  valuations  are  based  on  quoted  market  prices  of  the  identicalunderlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in lessactive markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniquesdue to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.Our  Level  3  non-marketable  debt  securities  and  non-marketable  equity  securities  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021  primarily  consist  of  common  stockinvestments and redeemable preferred stock investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.Depending  on  the  investee\u2019s  financing  activity  in  a  reporting  period,  management\u2019s  estimate  of  fair  value  may  be  primarily  derived  from  the  investee\u2019sfinancing  transactions,  such  as  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  to  new  investors.  The  price  in  these  transactions  generally  provides  the  best  indication  of  theenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information byusing other valuation techniques, including the(1)(1) 98",

usescomparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarilyconsists of short-term revenue projections.Once  the  fair  value  of  the  investee  is  estimated,  an  option-pricing  model  (\u201cOPM\u201d),  a  common  stock  equivalent  (\u201cCSE\u201d)  method  or  a  hybrid  approach  isemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.The model involves making assumptions around theinvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, couldresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value.Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.In thefuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification

These observed inputswere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that wasapplied  to  the  valuation  derived  from  Grab\u2019s  latest  financing  transaction  which  occurred  earlier  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and  prior  to  the  announcement  ofCOVID-19  as  a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As  a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was  reduced  by$230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balancesheet  and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  thesignificant uncertainty about Grab\u2019s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected wasconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost wasconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.The fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by theinvestee during that quarter.

(loss) for non-marketable equity securities$\u2014 $(1,690)$71 We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potentialimpairment  indicators.This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,  significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities.As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carrying value.To determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted  at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities  within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services.These inputs areconsidered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity.Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in the OPM approach.The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult  in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario.As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.There wasno remeasurement event for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.The following

Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity ownership interest to approximately 33%.The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise significant influence over MLU B.V.The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V.The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020During 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest.The contribution ofDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilution of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%.The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V.

component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach.The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount.At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening accumulated deficit.As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021

The  redomiciliation  resulted  in  a  step-up  in  the  tax  basis  of  intellectual  property  rights  and  a  correlated  increase  in  foreigndeferred tax assets in an amount of $6.4 billion, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion (refer to the 2019 rate impact for \u201cChange inunrecognized tax benefits\u201d). Based on available objective evidence, management believed it was not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreigndeferred tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, were offset by a full valuation allowance (refer to the 2019 rate impact for\u201cValuation  allowance\u201d) to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain  tax positions.

The current year tax expense and any subsequent changes in the recognition ormeasurement of this deferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing operations.Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferredtax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences  and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax  assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and  tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The  indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities being used as a source of income.As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover period.

The  dilutive  effect  ofoutstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method,as applicable.We  take  into  account  the  effect  on  consolidated  net  income  (loss)  per  share  of  dilutive  securities  of  entities  in  which  we  hold  equity  interests  that  areaccounted for using the equity method.123", "369ff566-75c3-410b-97a5-1a9012548bec": "The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in millions, except share amountswhich are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):Year Ended December 31,201920202021Basic net loss per share:NumeratorNet loss including non-controlling interests$(8,512)$(6,788)$(570)Add: net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax(6)(20)(74)Net loss attributable to common stockholders$(8,506)$(6,768)$(496)DenominatorBasic weighted-average common stock outstanding1,248,353 1,752,960 1,892,546 Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders $(6.81)$(3.86)$(0.26)Diluted net loss per share:NumeratorNet loss attributable to common stockholders$(8,506)$(6,768)$(496)Net loss attributable to Freight Holding convertible common shares non-controlling interest, netof tax\u2014 \u2014 (44)Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders$(8,506)$(6,768)$(540)DenominatorNumber of shares used in basic net loss per share computation1,248,353 1,752,960 1,892,546 Weighted-average effect of potentially dilutive securities:Assumed redemption of Freight Holding convertible common shares, non-controlling interest\u2014 \u2014 2,973 Diluted weighted-average common stock outstanding1,248,353 1,752,960 1,895,519 Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders $(6.81)$(3.86)$(0.29)Per share amounts are calculated using unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate.Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach.

Superior Court in 2018.Under the ABC test, workersperforming  services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed for the hiring entity.On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d).The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.The injunction was stayed pending appeal.On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court.", "b33fdadc-b9c4-4b55-8e55-ff976785cbe7": "The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers.As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors127", "77408ec6-b105-4dbc-9f38-bdafba15a94d": "under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16,2020.The  California  Supreme  Court  declined  the  petition  for  review  on  February  10,  2021.The  lawsuit  was  returned  to  the  trial  court  following  the  appellateproceedings on February 22, 2021.On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction withthe trial  court.On April 16, 2021, the trial  court  signed an order  granting the stipulation.Although the preliminary  injunction  has been dissolved, the lawsuitremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22.We have petitioned to stay this matterpending  coordination  with  other  California  employment  related  matters,  which  was  granted  and  a  coordination  judge  was  assigned.We  intend  to  continue  tovigorously defend ourselves.Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.In  addition,  in  January  2021,  a  petition  was  filed  with  the  California  Supreme  Court  by  several  drivers  and  a  labor  union  alleging  that  Proposition  22  isunconstitutional, which was denied.The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, theAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional.On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision withthe California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization has also filed an appeal.Massachusetts Attorney General LawsuitOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft.The complaint alleges Driversare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws.The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss thecomplaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021.A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion inwhich we argue that the motion is premature.The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022.Our chances of success onthe merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.Swiss Social Security ReclassificationSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or ofUber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes.We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.In April 2021, aruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions.The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V.are still pending for years 2014 to 2019.In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 asdependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno impact on our current operations.The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for thismatter is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.On October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting thatthey should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors.Thetribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment ofthe App in July 2016.The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018.We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes.Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber.", "f1396d86-8c47-4c79-a4f9-2f35e42b6afb": "They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan.We have also completed asettlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.Our portal for drivers to register fora  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  have  extended  offers  to  all  drivers  eligible  forsettlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.Compensation hearings will take placein 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, andholiday pay.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.We have completed theenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for thesematters within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.128", "eb417afb-373a-4ae0-b435-a4f6ae653dbc": "Other Driver Classification MattersAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative  actions,  and  government  investigations  and  audits  challenging  our  classification  of  Drivers  as  independent  contractors  and  not  employees.Webelieve that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, couldhave a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of thesematters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and otherfactors.State Unemployment TaxesIn  2018,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d)  opened  an  audit  reviewing  whether  Drivers  were  independent  contractors  or  employees  forpurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018.The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,against both Rasier and Uber.Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interestsowed from 2014 through 2018.The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021.We have submitted payment for the principalrevised amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments.While the ultimate resolution of this matter isuncertain, we recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. LevandowskiOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir  respective  employment  agreements  with  Google,  fraud  and  other  state  law  violations  (due  to  soliciting  Google  employees  and  starting  a  new  venture  tocompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements).Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution.On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable.In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims.The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019.On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million.Uber paid Googleon behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation.A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy.Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction.Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC.For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement in principle that isscheduled for an approval hearing with the court on March 3, 2022.While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we have recorded for this matterwithin accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Non-Income Tax MattersWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities withregard to such matters.The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes.In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe  applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as  well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  onpayments made to such Drivers.We are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider.", "6f53c5de-1063-4bbd-998c-2517e6f81947": "Beingclassified  as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively.HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation services.HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC.If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow.We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings.Our  estimated  liability  is  inherently  subjective  due  to  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  the  judicial  processes  in  certain  jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome could be different from the estimated liability recorded.129", "2dfb14a1-43e5-4ef9-b53c-b3ac219298f8": "Other Legal and Regulatory MattersWe  have  been  subject  to  various  government  inquiries  and  investigations  surrounding  the

We issued the Careem Notes in different tranches with $880 million of the principal amountof the Careem Notes issued on January 2, 2020 and settled in cash on April 1, 2020. Each tranche of the Careem Notes is due and payable 90 days once issued. Theholders of the Careem Notes may elect to convert the full outstanding principal balance to Class A common stock at a conversion price of $55 per share of UberTechnologies, Inc. at any time prior to maturity. The discount from the Careem Notes face value to fair value will be accreted through the respective repaymentdates as interest expense.During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes and as a result of such elections, $539 million ofthe principal amount of the Careem Notes matured, of which $307 million were settled in cash and $232 million were settled in equity.The remaining amount of the Careem Notes is recognized as a commitment to issue unsecured convertible notes at fair value in accrued and other currentliabilities of $238 million as of December 31, 2021.

entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d),operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico.During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial CornershopInvestment\u201d).The remaining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico.As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin order for Uber to acquire
