people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.OverviewLyft,  Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission.Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d).Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change.Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada.We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work.As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation.We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft  Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings.We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use.We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders.We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace.As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue.We also generate revenue fromriders  renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs.In the secondquarter of 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We have made focused and substantial  investments  in support of our mission.For example,  to continually  launch new innovations on our platform,  we haveinvested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions.We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness.Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platform and scaled user network.Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses.Wealso continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology on the Lyft network.Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a leader in TaaS.Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We  believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.", "1f2e64cd-0f53-4d0b-aa93-4666c2e1ea67": "Through  our  LyftUpinitiative, we\u2019re working to make sure people have

commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030.We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.Our values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business.We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services,including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment.As we progress through the COVID-19 recovery, we remain confident the demand for ourofferings will continue to grow as more and more people discover and rely on the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.5", "fcc378fb-2b48-4a92-a825-fcf0a85ed02e": "Impact of COVID-19 to our BusinessThe  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments  and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.Although we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe  office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot be presently estimated.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing  and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

offer access to autonomous vehicles.Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerlyAptiv) has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas.In July 2021, we completed a multi-elementtransaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5,as  well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  and  commercialization of  the  automated-drivingvehicles that

powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.We have established one of the largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada.While network scale is important, we

cases.We offerproducts to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity safe rides programs.We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\u2022Grow Active Riders.We see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.We may make incrementalinvestments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft.We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency.We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels.Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork  coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.\u2022Grow Our Share of Consumers\u2019 Transportation Spend.Lyft\u2019s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs.The Lyft networkspans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services.By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.\u2022Deliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers.We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities.For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing.We\u2019ve also been investing in ourDriver  Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.By  making  the  driverexperience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft\u2019s network.\u2022Invest in our Marketplace Technology.Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers andriders.Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficientand seamless to use.\u2022Thoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships.", "ca219fe5-3c7e-47a0-b8e0-b2e3b7f87f9d": "In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshare Holdings LLC (\u201cMotivate\u201d), the largest bike sharing platform inthe

scooter sharing market includeLime and Bird.Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces.We also compete with certain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.Additionally,  there  are  other  non-U.S.-based  TaaS  network  companies,  non-ridesharing  transportation  network  companies  and  traditional  automotivemanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada, such as

our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dryseasons.Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19.In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand.Although we have seensome signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recoveryremain uncertain.We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of suchmeasures, as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand

delight.Our marketingefforts bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and socialmedia engagement.We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider communityOur marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers andriders.Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events,and outdoor advertisements.We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend.We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more.We continue to engage with current riders througha variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.Our Commitment to SafetyA strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust.Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers andriders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerlyknown as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key

remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.\u2022Mandatory safety education.Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These  programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and reporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\u2022Emergency help, supported by ADT.If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with anADT security professional.\u2022Hidden contact information and ride history.The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride.While ridersand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed.Drivers are also not ableto see a rider\u2019s drop-off location, whether it\u2019s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\u2022Two-way ratings and mandatory feedback.At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars.Any rider ordriver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details.Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never bematched with that individual again through the app.In 2021, we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which are statistically very rare.From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips in this period.However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and ourgoal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.Government RegulationWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United

 31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks.Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineering, design and science organizations.Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority.We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger.As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall.The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon  self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.As  of  December  31,  2021,employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent internally, and open up pathways for advancement.We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone  Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of the most powerful examples of Lyft\u2019s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness.We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive year to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation.We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers\u2019  annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family.Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors not accounted for in the statistical models we used.In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate business factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty and as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are represented by a labor union.We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.In December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website.We have presented this report since2017 and intend to continue to present this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.Environmental, Social and Corporate GovernanceIn May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website.We began publishing

we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030.By working with drivers to transition to EVs, we have the potential to avoid tens of millions of metric tons of GHG emissions to the atmosphere and to reduce gasolineconsumption  by  more  than  a  billion  gallons  over  the  next  decade.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it\u2019s good for people \u2013 riders,drivers, and the communities they serve.SocialWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect and a common objective of improving people\u2019s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we\u2019re working to enable access to affordable,reliable transportation for all \u2014 no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, bike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\u2022Jobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022Grocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022Community Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyperlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022Micromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\u2022Universal Vaccine Access Campaign - mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\u2022Disaster Response - provides rides to access vital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\u2022Voting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and communities of color.In response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or share where they are going or why.Corporate GovernanceOur board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe utmost business integrity.

financial condition and results of operations.Weare unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operationsand the achievement of our strategic objectives.Our business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, suchas travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders.The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue tocause,  decreased  demand  for  our  platform  relative  to pre-COVID-19  demand,  disruptions  in  global  supply chains,  and  significant  volatility  and disruption  of  financialmarkets.The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, thosediscussed below:\u2022Declines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platformwhich has decreased our revenues.These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform.Wepaused our shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021.While certain typesof  travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  andbehavior arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to thisadverse effect.\u2022Changes in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certainmarkets.This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operation.\u2022The responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations  to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.We  may  be  required  to  or  choosevoluntarily to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respectto vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of ourplatform.The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident.Tothe extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u2022We design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles that meet our standards is critical to our operations.We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared LightVehicles and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services.We have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemicrelated  to  these  assets,  such  as  delays  in  their  manufacture  and  delivery  and  increased  costs  associated  with  manufacturing  and  shipping,  and  we  may  faceadditional challenges in future periods.These challenges may adversely affect our ability to deploy new Light Vehicles on our network or to implement newfeatures on our network of Light Vehicles.These supply chain issues have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\u2022The impacts of COVID-19 have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program,and for the fleet rented to users through Lyft Rentals.", "58996325-cbb2-4d0a-adfb-73c3af55c113": "Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft\u2019s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto COVID-19.For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19.Further, while ExpressDrive rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure to COVID-19.As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees.In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed.In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have testedpositive for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time.Further,

salaryreductions, which may have adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees.As the severity, magnitude and durationof the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic\u2019simpact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remainsuncertain and difficult to predict.As the pandemic continues, the recovery of the economy and our business have fluctuated and varied by geography.Further, theultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that arenot within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to thepandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto onlocal  or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;evolving laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key marketsand financial market volatility; volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent ofany virus mutations or new strains of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\u2022In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results.Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, theInternet or the operations of our third-party technology providers.In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known forseismic activity and increasingly for fires.The impact of climate change may increase these risks.In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,other epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or other catastrophic events,whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole.For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region.The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or ourthird-party providers\u2019 abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations.All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders.", "201f234e-b63e-4ac4-97e2-a31b6b4db3cf": "A deterioration ofgeneral  macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slower  growth  or  recession,  inflation,  changes  to  fuel  and  other  energy  costs  or  vehicle  costs,  or  decreases  in

"0449cf84-e7e8-480b-b941-81da73274ba5": "Risks Related to Operational FactorsOur limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.While we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly expand ourplatform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused ourbusiness model. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks andchallenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\u2022forecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\u2022attract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\u2022comply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\u2022manage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions,including  travel  bans,  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders,  as  well  as  maintain  demand  for  and  confidence  in  the  safety  of  our  platform  during  andfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic;\u2022plan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles or certain vehicles in the Express Driveprogram and the fleet of vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\u2022develop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, MobileServices, Lyft Auto Care, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology;\u2022anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\u2022maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\u2022effectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\u2022successfully expand our geographic reach;\u2022hire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\u2022successfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\u2022right-size our real estate portfolio.If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial model andoperate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model oroperated  in  a  more  predictable  market.  We  have  encountered  in  the  past,  and  will  encounter  in  the  future,  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by  growingcompanies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate ourbusiness, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Prior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly andwe have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenuegrowth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in themidst of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the future, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19", "6ef8af74-6b4b-4e2d-ab81-6ea7e395f580": "Our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets and continue toinvest  in  our  platform  and  customer  engagement,  or  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.These  efforts  may  be  more  costly  than  we  expect  and  may  not  result  inincreased  revenue  or  growth  in  our  business.For  example,  we  have  incurred  and  will  continue  to  incur  additional  costs  and  expenses  associated  with  the  passage  ofProposition 22 in California including providing drivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards healthcare coverage,occupational accident insurance and minimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with theCOVID-19 pandemic, including sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Furthermore, we have expanded overtime to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and Lyft Auto Care.We are also expanding the supportavailable to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft AutoCare, and through our Express Drive vehicle rental  program.In addition, we have established  environmental  programs, such as our commitment  to 100% EVs on ourplatform by the end of 2030.These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected.In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,  stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized  over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.Any  failure  to  increase  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  our  investments  and  otherexpenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis.If we are unable to successfully address these risks andchallenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.As our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results ofoperations will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our businessmodel and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities.If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incursignificant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices and offerings.We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greaterresources or other strategic advantages.",

compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.Our results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons,many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, theresults of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operationsto fluctuate in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or theexpectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.The ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development andif such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely affected.Prior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow,particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is new and unproven, and it isuncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on thewillingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings. We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact thewillingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters. In addition, we paused our shared rides offerings(though we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from operating our bike share and scootershare programs in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently temporarily suspendedrentals of scooters due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. Although the scooter rental suspension was lifted in February 2021, in the event of a resurgence ofCOVID-19, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again.

foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease  utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle.If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and

platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business.For example,during the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand visiting business venues were or have been eased.This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted.Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure.Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient.Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour  expenses.Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.Thisincludes  a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal with Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal).If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe  required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions.We may face specific risksrelating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.If  drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected.Further, incentives we provide to attract driverscould fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to increase utilization by existing drivers, or could have other unintended adverse consequences.In addition, changesin certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool ofqualified drivers, which may result in increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and

andunderinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certainlimits.To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurancepolicies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions.In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers.In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with athird-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments.Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as ofDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory

insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when ourpolicies are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure.Our business,

estimate  ourinsurance reserves.Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.While an independent actuary firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can affect theactual losses incurred for any given

the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs.For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses forclaims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements.If we determinethat our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to ournet loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.For example, the adverse development toinsurance reserves we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021 was largely attributable to historical auto losses that are associated with accident liabilities between 2018and 2020.We rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to

expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal resources.We may, from time to time, explore the possibility of selling portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties.This may cause us to incur additional expenses inthe  total  cost  of  this  risk.For  example,  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2020,  we  entered  into  a  Novation  Agreement  to  transfer  nearly  all  of  our  primary  auto  insuranceliabilities  related  to  periods  preceding  October  2018  to  a  third-party,  in  October  2020,  we  expanded  our  rideshare  insurance  program  to

constraints and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies.Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof offerings.Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do.Thisincludes the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders.From time to time, we havemade pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers on our platform,

our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively in these locations.Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects.For example, state and local lawsand  regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets,

scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing markets willcontinue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related offerings will be successful insuch markets.For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages.The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support.However, Joco continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, couldadversely affect our competitive position and results of operations.Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating due to public health and safety measures,

COVID-19 pandemic  and again suspended rentals  of scooters from December  2020through February 2021 and for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program.While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Even if we are ableto successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering.In particular, there couldbe negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves.Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or incidents involving our

prevent  us,  or  our  current  orprospective partners and suppliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous vehicle technology.Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, weno longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologyon our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if ourefforts  to  optimize  our  strategy  with  regard  to  our  autonomous  vehicle  technology  development  are  not  successful,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adversely affected.The autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our prospects,business, financial condition and results of operations.We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform.Autonomous drivinginvolves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology.We have relied both on our own research anddevelopment and on strategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity.There is noassurance that this research and development or these partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manneror at all and as a result of the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, we are more reliant on partnerships for this

technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\u2022market acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\u2022state, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\u2022necessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\u2022concerns regarding electronic security and privacy; and\u2022public perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.There  are  a  number  of  existing  laws,  regulations  and  standards  that  may  apply  to  autonomous  vehicle  technology,  including  vehicle  standards  that  were  notoriginally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver.Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,conflicting or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the compliancecosts associated with this business strategy.In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such acceptance, if atall, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market.Even if autonomous vehicle technologyis successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public

adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has increased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market.We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle

and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along a similar route.If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the level of rider demand.We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and such fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride.The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match.Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride.We earn platform andservice fees from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties.As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated.We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless  than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.In  addition,  riders\u2019  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable

infringement claims or the quality of the code.In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others tocompromise our platform and offerings.Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of opensource software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property.If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public.This would allow our competitors to create similarofferings  with lower  development  effort  and time  and  ultimately  could result  in a  loss of our competitive  advantages.Alternatively,  to avoid the public  release  of theaffected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.Although we have processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many opensource licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipatedconditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings.From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of opensource software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions.As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership ofwhat we believe to be open source software.Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will beeffective.If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or otherliability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform,to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, ourproprietary code,

addition, we have several international offices thatsupport our business.We also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international

lack  ofspecificity.As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided byregulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The ridesharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving.When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012,the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings.Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since beenadopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharingmarketplace.We  have  been  proactively  working  with  federal,  state  and  local  governments  and  regulatory  bodies  to  ensure  that  our  ridesharing  marketplace  and  otherofferings are available broadly in the United States and Canada.In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address theunique issues of the ridesharing industry.New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted inresponse to our industry and related technologies.As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courtsmay claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or thatusers on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings.", "cfcb5b3c-670a-4fc8-b6cc-746663258d1b":

is relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated.We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms.Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The  City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms.The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation.Other jurisdictions inwhich we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit.We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents.Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators.These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors.The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive.Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent  contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.For  moreinformation regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the \u201cLegal

intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights.In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.As we gain an increasingly  high public  profile  and the number  of competitors  in our market  increases  and as we continue to develop new technologies  andintellectual property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion.From timeto time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us.See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional information about these types of legal proceedings.In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and, in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions.Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us.Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us.In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many  potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty rights.Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation.We may be required to pay substantialdamages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses.Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and thereforeour competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us.If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all,we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which we would be unableto continue to offer our

entities.Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  ourConcierge or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA.We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclosethe PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities.Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breachnotification obligations, and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a \u201cbreach.\u201d If we knowingly breach theHITECH Act\u2019s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability.A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from $100 -$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for \u201cwillful neglect\u201d violations and the possibility of

obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, wemay face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effortto do so.In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them.Aswe consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs

securities laws, and other matters, and we may become subjectto  additional  types  of  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations  and  legal  or  regulatory  proceedings  as  our  business  grows  and  as  we  deploy  new  offerings  such  asautonomous  vehicle  technology,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  deliveries,  including  proceedings  related  toproduct  liability  or  our  acquisitions,  securities  issuances  or  business  practices.We  are  also  regularly  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  arbitration  proceedings,  governmentinvestigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform.See the section titled\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.The results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted withcertainty.Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  be  harmful  to  our  reputation,  require  significantmanagement attention and divert significant resources.Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive  process that requires significantsubjective  judgment  and  speculation.It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  result  in  substantial  damages,  settlement  costs,  fines  andpenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.These proceedings could also44", "f8eb238b-0aae-481f-a904-c5366d155a21": "result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices.Any of these consequencescould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligationsto indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.A  determination  in,  or  settlement  of,  any  legal  proceeding,  whether  we  are  party  to  such  legal  proceeding  or  not,  that  involves  our  industry,  could  harm  ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In addition, we regularly include arbitration  provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform.These provisions are intended tostreamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court.However,arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny.In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litigation costs and exposure.For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection.If ourarbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand  regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.As we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction to another.Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate oraddress the unique issues faced by our industry.For example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws andregulations.These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf ofhealthcare partners.Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the costsassociated  with  our  offerings  to  healthcare  partners.With  respect  to  our  healthcare  rides  matched  through  the  Lyft  Platform  and  provided  to  Medicaid  or  MedicareAdvantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations.Significant violations of such laws could lead to ourloss of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.Further, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain riskssuch as the government\u2019s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector\u2019s budgetary cycles and funding authorization, and the government\u2019s administrative andinvestigatory processes.Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings orplatform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations.", "bd1a8bb6-9fc2-4769-bdbb-1ff683cd05ed": "Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our platform offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of rider fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or privateclaims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.The actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws.For example, the TCPA restricts certain telemarketing and the use of certain automated SMS text messages without proper consent.This has resulted and may in the futureresult in civil claims against us.The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving anddeveloping.If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business,financial

among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and proceduresand internal control over financial reporting.We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information requiredto be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and formsand that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.We arealso continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting.We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order tomaintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increasedcomplexity resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19 and permanent work-from-home  and  hybrid  work  arrangements,  new  offerings  on  our  platform  or  from  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  and  divestitures.Further,  weaknesses  in  ourdisclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future.Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficultiesencountered  in  their  implementation  or  improvement,  could  harm  our  results  of  operations  or  cause  us  to  fail  to  meet  our  reporting  obligations  and  may  result  in  arestatement of our financial statements for prior periods.Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adverselyaffect  the  results  of  periodic  management  evaluations  and  annual  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  attestation  reports  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  ourinternal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports.Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control overfinancial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of ourClass A common stock.In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control overfinancial reporting is documented, designed or operating.Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have anadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes andmay successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to businesses like ours andto drivers is a complex and evolving issue.Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of theInternet and e-commerce.Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates andare subject to adjustments.In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or todrivers\u2019 businesses.In addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislativeaction to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes.For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically onTNC rides.As one example, voters in San Francisco approved \u201cProposition D\u201d in November of 2019, which imposes a percentage-based tax on TNC rides originating inthe city.", "f22beff8-bfa7-4d79-b35a-6077f7a14a3e": "Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, andwe may face indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes.However, tax authorities have raisedand may continue to raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictionsin which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest.A successful assertion by one or more taxauthorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes,could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing ourofferings  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.Although  we  have  reserved  for  potential  payments  of  possible  past  taxliabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Additionally,  one  or  more  states,  localities  or  other  taxing  jurisdictions  may  seek  to  impose  additional  reporting,  record-keeping  or  indirect  tax  collectionobligations on businesses like ours.For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place46", "dd3f6d8a-1a08-47b6-8e6a-952385568abf": "over the Internet, and are considering related legislation.After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted laws thatwould require tax reporting, collection or tax remittance on items sold online.Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which wouldharm our business.New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.Operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.In addition, certain members of our managementteam have limited experience managing a public company.As a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.For example, we are subject to thereporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, therules  and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  the  listing  standards  of  the  Nasdaq  Stock  Market.For  example,  the  Exchange  Act  requires,  among  other  things,  we  file  annual,quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls andprocedures and internal control over financial reporting.Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financialcompliance  costs,  and  increase  demand  on  our  systems.In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  may  be  subject  to  stockholder  activism,  which  can  lead  to  additionalsubstantial  costs,  distract  management  and  impact  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business  in  ways  we  cannot  currently  anticipate.As  a  result  of  disclosure  ofinformation in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation,including by competitors.Certain  members  of  our  management  team  have  limited  experience  managing  a  publicly  traded  company,  interacting  with  public  company  investors  andcomplying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies.Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being apublic company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts andinvestors.These  obligations  and  constituents  will  require  significant  attention  from  our  senior  management  and  could  divert  their  attention  away  from  the  day-to-daymanagement of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.We have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure theefficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks whereverbusiness is conducted.For example,  our San Francisco,  California  headquarters  is projected  to  be vulnerable  to future  water  scarcity  and sea level  rise  due to climatechange, as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs.Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weatherevents and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of ourcustomers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.Additionally, we are subject to emerging climatechange policies such as California\u2019s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meetthe future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public

challenge  our  ability  to  progress  toward  our  100%  EVcommitment.Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise notsuccessful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected.We may also enter into arrangements with thirdparties for financing, leasing or

all.Historically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations.Tosupport our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential new offerings.In May 2020,we issued $747.5 million in aggregate principal amount47",

capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us toobtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, businessplans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.Additionally, COVID-19 may impact our access to capital andmake additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us.We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorableterms, or at all.If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our businessgrowth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieveour objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.As  part  of  our  business  strategy,  we  will  continue  to  consider  a  wide  array  of  potential  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  of  businesses,  newtechnologies,  services  and  other  assets  and  strategic  investments  that  complement  our  business,  such  as  our  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  in  February  2020,  as  well  asdivestitures, partnerships and other transactions.We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascentmarkets.As we grow, we also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may

generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be

concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the outcomeof important transactions, including a change in control.Our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share.Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued andoutstanding  shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.", "1baa5f5f-7adc-4dd3-ad63-b3744970d47b": "Accordingly,  Logan  Green,  our  co-founder,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors  holdsapproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holdsapproximately 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influencematters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale ofall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions.Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may votein a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests.This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a changein  control  of  our company,  could  deprive  our  stockholders  of  an opportunity  to  receive  a  premium  for  their  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  sale  of our  company  and  mightultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.Each Co-Founder\u2019s voting power is as of December 31, 2021 and includes shares of Class A commonstock expected to be issued upon the vesting of such Co-Founder\u2019s RSUs within 60 days of December 31, 2021.Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limitedexceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes.In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share ofClass A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common stock held by ourCo-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permittedentities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or becomedisabled of our Co-Founders, or such50", "5366a1e3-7c6f-4fab-bdc2-0e541169954a": "later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity orother adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of its  indices;  however,  in October  2018, MSCI announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  \u201cwithunequal voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on thevaluations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class Acommon stock could be adversely affected.The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price ofour Class A common stock include the following:\u2022price  and  volume  fluctuations  in  the  overall  stock  market  from  time  to  time,  including  fluctuations  due  to  general  economic  uncertainty  or  negative  marketsentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\u2022volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate tothe operating performance of those technology companies;\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\u2022sales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or purchasescould occur;\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet theseestimates or the expectations of investors;\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\u2022investor sentiment and the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others inour industry;\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\u2022short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;51", "ca29b1fd-192e-4618-a7ed-7d515198b5e4": "\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential newlaws or regulations;\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\u2022any significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.In  addition,  in  the  past,  following  periods  of  volatility  in  the  overall  market  and  the  market  price  of  a  particular  company\u2019s  securities,  securities  class  actionlitigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have been filed inCalifornia state and federal courts and derivative actions have been filed in Delaware and California federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, andcertain  of  the  underwriters  named  in  our  IPO  Registration  Statement  alleging  violation  of  securities  laws,  breach  of  fiduciary  duties,  and  other  causes  of  action  inconnection with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception  that such sales have or could occur, could depress the market price of our Class Acommon stock.The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and theperception  that  these  sales  have  or  could  occur  may  also  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  including  if  there  is  short-selling  or  other  hedgingtransactions.We have filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United States in the open market.Sales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Thesesales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxycontest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which theperson became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\u2022any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws require the approval of at least two-thirds of ourthen-outstanding voting

"\u2022our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may beissued without further action by our stockholders; and\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company.These provisions could alsodiscourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any ofwhich, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could alsoaffect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between usand our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising underthe Securities Act, each of which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the soleand exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of ourdirectors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amendedand

officers or otheremployees,  which  may  discourage  lawsuits  against  us  and  our  directors,  officers  and  other  employees.If  a  court  were  to  find  the  exclusive-forum  provisions  in  ouramended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions,which could harm our results of operations.If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change theirrecommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business,our market or our competitors.The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations.If any of the analystswho cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors orpublish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline.If one or more of these securities analysts cease coverage ofus or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price andtrading

(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assetsrelated  to  our  self-driving  vehicle  division,  Level  5,  as  well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  andcommercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing.We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued operation.We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for informationregarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liability InsuranceOn April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the\u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date.Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded toDARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with anaggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d).The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC ofits obligations to the policyholder.A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement ofoperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.Active Riders and Revenue per Active RiderThe  COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  significant  decrease  in  Active  Riders  and

during the quarter,that person would count as two Active Riders.If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider.If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App.Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account.Accordingly,Lyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir ride in the Lyft App.This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020.Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were excluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods  ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities fully reopened.Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts from COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods  in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders.Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared to the three months ended September 30, 2021.This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides, reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide.Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and dataaccess agreements, beginning in the second quarter of 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  are  prepared  in  accordance  withGAAP.The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  also  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures.We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonableunder the circumstances.Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.", "f5bac8b8-8956-42e3-980c-ba86e105f77c": "To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, ourfuture financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.Accordingly, we believe these are the mostcritical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to ourconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue RecognitionRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)We generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders.We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers foruse of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.Drivers enter into terms ofservice (\u201cToS\u201d) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.58", "5c7a4ab5-4e61-49c1-bca3-54a9d7af61d7": "We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders.This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform.As a result, our singleperformance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider.We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider.The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service to theircustomer  through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction price through the platform.We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices.As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606.As our customary business practice, a contract existsbetween the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider.We collect the fare and related charges from riderson behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider.In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fullymitigated.We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We  recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the completion of the ride.We offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.In some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace.Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription period.We generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements.We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access toFlexdrive vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period.We act as a principal in delivering the data and accesslicenses and present revenue on a gross basis.Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by assigning therelative fair value to each of the performance obligations.", "6fbbccc3-eb07-4481-bd64-72124fe819e7":

Level 5.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)We  generate  rental  revenues  primarily  from  Flexdrive,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  and  Lyft  Rentals.Under  the  Flexdrive  and  Lyft  Rentals  programs,  weoperate a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies.We either lease or sublease vehicles todrivers and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842.Forvehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements.Driverswho rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the Lyft Platform.59", "061d0d78-de23-46e4-94f9-01085ba2ac18": "Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride.Revenue generated from Flexdriveand Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance ReservesWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.Liabilities are determined ona quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss development factors among other inputs and assumptions.On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience.Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves.A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation.Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from previous actuarial projections.The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However, while webelieve that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.As a result, the net amounts that willultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Stock-Based CompensationWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).We estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricingmodel.The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.Werecognize compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The  fair  value  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  estimated  based  on  the  fair  market  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the satisfaction ofboth a service condition and a performance condition.Compensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of  our  IPORegistration Statement on March 28, 2019.On that date we recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the accelerated attributionmethod for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019.The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to theseRSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods.",

basis over the requisite service period.As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation costrelated to RSUs was $587.5 million, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.Business CombinationsWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchaseconsideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.The excess of the fair value ofpurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to bereasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.During the measurement period, not to exceedone year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new informationis obtained related to facts and60", "23ecb0f7-670e-41b9-bb94-86a73bb073df": "circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the fair value of assetsreceived. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determinewhether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting pronouncements notyet adopted as of the date of this report. Components of Results of OperationsAs noted above, we expect to see decreased levels of demand for our platform, decreased numbers of new rider activations, and negative impacts on revenue for solong as responsive measures  to COVID-19 remain  in place when compared  to levels prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  in March  2020. We have adoptedmultiple measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that these actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on ourbusiness. In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results in future periods.Revenue RecognitionRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use ourConcierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from our vehicle service centers and revenue fromlicensing and data access agreements. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Policiesand Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and our network of Light Vehicles, whichincludes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles.

these measuresand a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see \u201cReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201dContribution and Contribution MarginContribution  and  Contribution  Margin  are  measures  used  by  our  management  to  understand  and  evaluate  our  operating  performance  and  trends.We  believeContribution and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time.Contribution Margin has generally increased overthe periods presented as revenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.We define Contribution as revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\u2022amortization of intangible assets;\u2022stock-based compensation expense;\u2022payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\u2022changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\u2022restructuring charges, if any.For more information about cost of revenue, see the section titled \u201cComponents of Results of Operations\u2014Cost of Revenue.\u201dContribution Margin is calculated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.We  record  changes  to  historical  liabilities  for  insurance  required  by  regulatory  agencies  for  financial  reporting  purposes  in  the  quarter  of  positive  or  adversedevelopment even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods.For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe prior period.We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years.We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims.Accordingly,including the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us.For consistency, we do notadjust the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end.Annual Contribution iscalculated by adding Contribution of the last four quarters.We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatoryagencies  from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current

deferred gain liability.When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used.The deferred gainliability would be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves.The settlementperiod of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter.The amount of thedeferral  will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated

unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod to offset said losses.We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance Agreement.This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove  over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies.As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed.This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date back years.Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.As of

internal  control  overfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearingunder Item 9A.Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reportingbased on our audits.We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to beindependent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.Webelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.", "efe34b1c-7c48-487b-8540-793d5cd0af77": "A company\u2019s internal control over financial reportingincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019sassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures may deteriorate.75", "37921a03-a387-4495-86e8-23bf5d05832b": "Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  (ii)involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.The  communication  of  critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical auditmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance,which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage,first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves totaled $1,069 million.Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves.Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors.These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge  to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement\u2019s  actuarially  determined  reserves.Developing  the  independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  historical  data  provided  bymanagement, and independently developing loss development factors.Valuation of Certain Elements of the Transaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof Lyft rideshare and fleet data.The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand  $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangementconsideration  was  attributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  theutilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data.For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certainassets  related  to  the  Level  5  division,  which  was  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Level  5  division  assets,  valued  under  the  replacement  cost  method,  and  the  estimatedstandalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using an adjusted market approach.", "fe659612-a021-4fe8-8e98-28e292cca879": "The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used toestimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the standaloneselling price of the rideshare data.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain elements of the transaction with Woven Planet isa critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  a high degree  of auditor  judgment  and  subjectivity  in performing  procedures  relating  to the  fair  value  of  the Level  5 division  assets  andestimated standalone selling price of the rideshare data due to the significant judgment by management when determining the values; (ii) the significant audit effort inevaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license; and(iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.76", "b6b41447-1f19-44b5-9af6-ccf84c5756a3": "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.

in  the  United  States  and  Canada  that  offer  access  to  a  variety  of  transportation  options  through  the  Company\u2019s  platform  and  mobile-basedapplications.This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle withriders  who  need  a  ride.The  Lyft  Platform  provides  a  marketplace  where  drivers  can  be  matched  with  riders  via  the  Lyft  App  where  the  Company  operates  as  atransportation network company (\u201cTNC\u201d).Transportation options through the Company\u2019s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connectsdrivers and riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft\u2019s network of Light Vehicles, the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter intoshort-term  rental  agreements  with  Flexdrive  or  a  third  party  for  vehicles

and Lyft Driver Centers and Lyft Auto Care, where drivers and riders canrequest auto maintenance and collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in certain markets.Basis of PresentationThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) andinclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.The  Company  uses  the  U.S.  dollar  predominantly  as  the  functional  currency  of  its  foreign  subsidiaries.For  foreign  subsidiaries  where  the  U.S.  dollar  is  thefunctional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations.For theforeign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded to aseparate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.Initial Public OfferingThe Company\u2019s registration  statement  on Form S-1 (the \u201cIPO Registration  Statement\u201d)  related  to its initial  public  offering  (\u201cIPO\u201d) was declared  effective  onMarch  28,  2019,  and  the  Company\u2019s  Class  A common  stock  began  trading  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  on  March  29,  2019.On April  2,  2019,  the  Companycompleted its IPO, in which the Company sold 32,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share.On April 9, 2019, the Companysold an additional 2,996,845 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share pursuant to the exercise of the

offeringexpenses of $7.7 million subject to certain cost reimbursements.Immediately  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  219,175,709  shares  of  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  then  outstanding  converted  into  an  equivalentnumber of shares of common stock.Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, whichauthorizes a total of 18,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 1,000,000,000 shares of preferred stock.", "e57ccef7-c223-4a29-aad5-34d1996b5143": "Upon thefiling of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 255,007,393 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock then outstanding were automatically reclassified intoan  equivalent  number  of  shares  of  the  Company\u2019s  Class  A  common  stock.Immediately  after  the  reclassification  and  prior  to  the  completion  of  the

stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements.As a result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has two classes of authorizedand outstanding common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock.2.Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesUse of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring the reporting periods.The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from other sources.Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85", "578ab07b-d9d6-43c2-9277-3a905ca4a4d4": "Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland  identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness. The Company continues to be impacted by COVID-19, but the long-term impact will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain andcannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, new information about additional variants, the availability and efficacy of vaccine distributions,additional or renewed actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemic or respond to its impact and altered consumer behavior, amongother things. The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 \u201cRestructuring\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events.The  Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft's  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financialstatements, the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of theCompany's assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized  on the consolidated  financial  statements  as soon as they become known. Actual  results could differ  from those estimates  and any such differences  may bematerial to the Company's financial statements.Segment InformationOperating  segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating  Decision  Maker  (\u201cCODM\u201d)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company\u2019s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer  is  the Company\u2019s  CODM. The  CODM reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of the United States.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand mobile-based applications. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognizedin accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (\u201cASC 606\u201d). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensingand data access, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles andLyft Rentals, which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (\u201cASC 842\u201d).The table below presents the Company's revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Revenue from contracts with

from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)The Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606.The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, \u201cfees\u201d) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp  where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany in order to use the Lyft Driver App.Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers.The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a transportation service to a rider.The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.As the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically is upon pickup of the rider.The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful transportation service for riders.The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe ride.The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606.The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.The Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements.The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata  and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis.Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations.Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)The Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals.Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies.TheCompany either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842.Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as applicable.For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements.Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the LyftPlatform.Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases.Revenuegenerated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride.Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals isrecognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Enterprise and Trade ReceivablesThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider\u2019s authorized payment method.", "d9c8f992-3d4e-4e0d-b209-3e64c1f4fdfa": "Uncollected fees areincluded  in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  represent  receivables  from  (i)  participants  in  the  Company\u2019s  enterpriseprograms (\u201cEnterprise Users\u201d), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as ofthe reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled with third-party payment processors.Underthe ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related chargesit collects from riders on behalf of drivers.Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers.The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers isincluded in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.The Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected.As a result of the adoption ofAccounting Standards Update No.2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\" (\u201cASC 326\u201d), the Company\u2019s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has beenaugmented to reflect the change from the incurred loss87", "7490c3b4-8696-4c72-9204-370e8690cf42": "model to the expected credit loss model.The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade  receivables  balance.In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability.The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.The Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019, respectively.The write-offs were immaterial  for the year ended December 31, 2021.The change in the allowance  for credit losses for the year endedDecember 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs.The change in the allowance for creditlosses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs.The change inthe allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.Incentive ProgramsThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform.Drivers generally receive cashincentives  while riders,  Light Vehicle  riders and Lyft Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or discounted  rides  under such incentive  programs.Incentives  provided  todrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price.As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver IncentivesThe  Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.TheCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely outcome method.Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue.Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received.Driver incentives forreferring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense.The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of the benefit received.The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider IncentivesThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform.Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:(i)Market-wide marketing promotions.Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company.Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)Targeted marketing promotions.Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders.An example isa promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto a targeted group of riders.The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar  to  marketing  coupons.", "d17af2af-ff59-4341-a843-b88281875233": "These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice  provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.Theseincentives represent marketing costs.When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.(iii)Rider referral programs.Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir first ride on the Lyft Platform.The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge recorded to sales and marketing  expense.Referral  coupons typically  expire within one year.The Company estimates breakage  using its historicalexperience.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88", "8d87030d-36f1-4777-8a0e-c303d5208d62": "Light Vehicle Rider and Lyft Rentals Renter IncentivesIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, in relation to the driver, rider, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters incentive programs, theCompany recorded $1.3 billion, $390.8 million and $560.3 million as a reduction to revenue and $64.7 million, $135.0 million and $381.5 million as sales and marketingexpense, respectively.RefundsFrom  time  to  time  the  Company  issues  credits  or  refunds  to  riders  unsatisfied  by  the  level  of  service  provided  by  the  driver.  There  is  no  legal  obligation  toremunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which are notrecoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, rider refunds were $19.1 million,$18.8 million and $33.9 million, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and was $6.5 million for theyear ended December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders were not material.Cost of RevenueCost  of  revenue  consists  of  costs  directly  related  to  revenue  generating  transactions  through  the  Company\u2019s  multimodal  platform  which  primarily  includesinsurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing andbike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges.Other  costs  included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  depreciation,amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.Operations and SupportOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email andchat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet support costs, andfees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer supportactivities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.Research and DevelopmentResearch  and  development  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs  and  facilities  costs.  Such  expenses  include  costs  related  to  theCompany\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related  compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders,advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $145.4million, $102.5 million and $188.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.General and AdministrativeGeneral  and  administrative  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  professional  services  fees,  certain  insurance  costs  that  aregenerally  not  required  under  TNC  regulations,  certain  loss  contingency  expenses  including  legal  accruals  and  settlements,  insurance  claims  administrative  fees,  policyspend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, PSUs, stock options, and ESPP purchase rights.The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables include:\u2022per share fair value of the underlying common stock;89", "05111364-efa2-4877-b628-3a607b9553ea": "\u2022exercise price;\u2022expected term;\u2022risk-free interest rate;\u2022expected annual dividend yield; and\u2022expected stock price volatility over the expected term.The Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for \u201cplain vanilla\u201d stock option awards.The expected term of the ESPPpurchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period.Since the Company has limited history as apublic company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies.The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasuryzero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.The fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.TheCompany recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition.Compensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration Statement on March 28, 2019.On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019.The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods.The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures.Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse.The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized.Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open.ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits.The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expenseline in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.The excess of the fairvalue of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.When determining the fair value of assets acquired andliabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.", "d25ca3a1-b705-4d24-855a-214a9deeb8a6": "Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are basedupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,90", "7d35bad1-26f7-4b62-a24f-154768671d14": "actual results may differ from estimates.During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to theassets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of theacquisition date.After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.Acquisitioncosts, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporatebonds.Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.Alsoincluded in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,2021 and 2020, and money market deposit accounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.InvestmentsDebt SecuritiesThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for the security,and  the  nature  of  the  transaction.Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The  Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operationsas an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore recovery of its amortized cost basis.If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors.Inmaking this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating  agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured  based on  the  Company's best  estimate  of  the cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.When  developing  its estimate  of  cash  flows expected  to  be collected,  theCompany  considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.Credit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations.Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.As of December 31, 2021, the Companyhad not recorded any credit impairments.The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.The Company's investments in debt securities include:(i)Cash  and  cash  equivalents.Cash  equivalents  include  certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an  originalmaturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.(ii)Short-term investments.Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which maturein twelve months or less.As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.(iii)Restricted investments.", "9b76ee76-8836-4514-b14b-5f624607f49d": "Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporatebonds and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insuranceproviders.Non-marketable Equity SecuritiesThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence ofobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment.The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist.Factors considered in this assessment include the investees\u2019 financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries and markets impacted byCOVID-19, and the time91", "2dddbf5e-baaf-41c1-b3d3-ea9ff830a602": "since  the  last  adjustment  to  fair  value,  among  others.If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit RiskThe Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents.Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists.The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse in pricing an asset or liability.The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:Level 1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.Level 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.Light Vehicle FleetThe Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters.Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months.As of December 31, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service.As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9 million.As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million.As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin service was not material.Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.Bikes are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.LeasesThe Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019.TheCompany elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical assessments of(1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs.In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is orcontains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset.TheCompany determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement.The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leasesor subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers.The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee.", "75b5abef-ab23-44c3-9bea-8a7e23773992": "If any of the following criteria are met, theCompany classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\u2022The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\u2022The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\u2022The lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economiclife of the underlying asset;\u2022The present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\u2022The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.92", "c7262910-965e-4294-a106-038f201d966a": "Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.LessorThe Company's lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals programs and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use riders.Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases.The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements.Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs.Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements.The Company mitigatesresidual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.LesseeThe Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals.For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term.The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat the Company will exercise such options.The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements.For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate.Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments based on information available at lease commencement.The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company\u2019s lease liability calculation.Operating leases are included inoperating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities \u2014 current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term.Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.The interest component of finance leases is included incost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe  related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two and  seven  years.Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized.When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costand accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in theperiod realized.Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets.Construction inprogress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management\u2019s estimate of the fair value ofassets received.", "6a8ad22a-b317-4837-8f0f-30023dacc5a5": "Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value.As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitativeassessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of theCompany\u2019s  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  quantitative  impairment  test  will  be  required.Alternatively,  the  Company  may  bypass  the  qualitativeassessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31,

assets,  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  businesscircumstances  indicate  that the carrying  amount  of the assets may not be fully recoverable.Such events and changes  may include:  significant  changes in performancerelative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy.The Company measuresrecoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate.If thecarrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.Therewas no impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Software Development CostsThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems.The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform the function intended.The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively.For the year ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.Insurance ReservesThe Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits.The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.Liabilities  aredetermined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions.On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance claims  may take years to completely settle,  and the Company has limited  historical loss experience.Because of the limited operational  history, theCompany  makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves.A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation.Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections.The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.As aresult, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe consolidated balance sheets.The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per ShareThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand participation rights in undistributed earnings.The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between commonstock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.The Company\u2019s redeemableconvertible  preferred  stock  contractually  entitles  the  holders  of  such  shares  to  participate  in  dividends  but  does  not  contractually  require  the  holders  of  such  shares  toparticipate in the Company\u2019s losses.", "0d561505-fb41-49b3-917a-1ee52ec79721": "There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject to repurchase.The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period.For periods in which theCompany reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to commonstockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.94", "9162e63a-1ae5-4597-b1e8-4b84eda3ac34": "Recent Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn  December  2019,

Services, LLC (\u201cFlexdrive\u201d)On February 7, 2020 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company completed its acquisition of Flexdrive for approximately $20.0 million and treated the acquisition as abusiness combination.The acquisition is expected to contribute to the growth of the Company's current business, and help expand the range of the Company's use cases.Prior to the acquisition, the Company acted as the lessee of Flexdrive\u2019s vehicles and sublessor for each vehicle prior to its rental by drivers.As of the Closing Date, theCompany  had  approximately  $133.1  million  of  operating  lease  right-of-use  assets  and  $130.1  million  of  operating  lease  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  related  to  thispreexisting contractual relationship with Flexdrive.This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the purchaseprice, resulting in a total acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.95",

consideration  over  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  Goodwill  isattributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (\u201cdeveloped technology\u201d intangible asset) and gaininggreater flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is a taxable businesscombination for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of thedeveloped technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were developed by discountingthese benefits to their present value.The results of operations for the acquired business have been included on the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company'sacquisition  of  Flexdrive.  Flexdrive's  results  of  operations  for  periods  prior  to  this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and,accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.Other AcquisitionsIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed two business combinations which are not material to the consolidated financial statements.Pro  forma  results  of  operations  have  not  been  presented  because  the  effects  of  the  acquisitions  were  not  material  to  the  Company\u2019s  consolidated  financialstatements.4. DivestituresTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The  divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company\u2019s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting  as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on therelative fair value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued usingan adjusted market approach..

LeasesReal Estate Operating LeasesThe Company leases real estate property at approximately 81 locations of which all leases have commenced as of December 31, 2021. These leases are classifiedas operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms vary from one month to eight years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the leaseterm  for  periods  varying  from  two  months  to  ten  years.  These  renewal  options  are  not  considered  in  the  remaining  lease  term  unless  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  theCompany will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representingthe fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by thelandlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.Flexdrive ProgramThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases areclassified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms varybetween one month to three years. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated tothe respective lease component.104", "b2be3226-d7ea-44c6-a63d-8c5a2fa2d682": "Lease Position as of December 31, 2021The table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms andpercentages):December 31, 2021December 31, 2020Operating LeasesAssetsOperating lease right-of-use assets$223,412 $275,756 LiabilitiesOperating lease liabilities, current$53,765 $49,291 Operating lease liabilities, non-current210,232 265,803 Total operating lease liabilities$263,997 $315,094 Finance LeasesAssetsFinance lease right-of-use assets$26,802 $28,108 LiabilitiesFinance lease liabilities, current13,556 20,795 Finance lease liabilities, non-current14,242 6,593 Total finance lease liabilities$27,798 $27,388 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years)Operating leases5.66.3Finance leases2.21.5Weighted-average discount rateOperating leases6.3 %6.4 %Finance leases2.8 %4.7 %_______________(1)This  balance  is  included  within  property and  equipment,  net  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  was primarily  related  to  leases  acquired  in  the  Flexdrive  transaction.

Commitments and ContingenciesNoncancelable Purchase CommitmentsIn March 2018, the Company entered into a noncancelable arrangement with AWS, a web-hosting services provider, under which the Company had an obligationto purchase a minimum amount of services from this vendor through June 2021. In January 2019 and May 2020, the parties modified the aggregate commitment amountsand  timing.  Under  the  amended  arrangement,  the  Company  committed  to  spend  an  aggregate  of  at  least  $300  million  between  January  2019  and  June  2022,  with  aminimum amount of $80 million in each of the three contractual periods, on services with AWS. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has made payments in excess of$300 million under the amended arrangement.In  November  2018,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Motivate,  a  New  York  headquartered  bikeshare  company.  Over  the  approximately  five  yearsfollowing the transaction,  the Company committed  to invest an aggregate  of $100 million  in the bikeshare  program for the New York metro area. The Company alsoassumed  certain  pre-existing  contractual  obligations  to  increase  the  bike  fleets  in  other  locations  which  are  not  considered  to  be  material.

parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business partners,investors, contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company\u2019s officers, directors and certain employees.The Company has agreed toindemnify and defend the indemnified party\u2019s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claimsbecause of the Company\u2019s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company.It is not possible to determine themaximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company\u2019s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved in each particular provision.To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,  or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the business.In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related to accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.For some matters for which a material lossis  reasonably  possible,  an estimate  of  the amount  of  loss or  range  of  losses  is not  possible  nor  is  the Company  able  to  estimate  the loss  or  range  of  losses that  couldpotentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies.Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.Independent Contractor Classification MattersWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For  example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.Labor  Code  sec.2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status.The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform.For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,  San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent  contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand material damages and penalties.", "aa5dd563-0eb9-436b-a0c8-32c108008b47": "On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia as employees until the end of the lawsuit.Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law.Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.OnApril 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22.On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber.The coordinationpetition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court.On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution.The California Supreme Courtdenied review on February 3, 2021.Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021.Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda lawsuit.On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable.Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal.Briefing is currently underway.Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.In September 2021, the Massachusetts Attorney Generalserved Lyft and Uber with a motion

business, financial conditionand  results  of  operations,  including  damages,  penalties  and  potential  suspension  of  operations  in  impacted  jurisdictions,  including  California  or  Massachusetts.TheCompany\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.Such regulatory scrutiny or actionmay create

Act,Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of drivers onthe Company\u2019s

leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are stilluncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.The  Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itself  vigorously  in  these  matters.However,  results  of  litigation,arbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materialimpact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverseimpact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually

including audits related to driver classification, in California, Oregon,Wisconsin,  Illinois,  New  York,  New  Jersey  and  North  Carolina.The  Company  believes  that  drivers  are  properly  classified  as  independent  contractors  and  plans  tovigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination.The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain.The Company accrues liabilities that mayresult from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recordedto general and administrative expenses.Indirect TaxesThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters.The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises fromdisputes  on  tax  treatment  and  tax  rates  applied  to  the  sale  of  the  Company\u2019s  services  in  these  jurisdictions.The  Company  accrues  indirect  taxes  that  may  result  fromexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general andadministrative expenses.Patent LitigationThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course ofbusiness, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or assertinginfringement of such property.The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters.The Company\u2019s chances ofsuccess on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot

Act of 1991, orTCPA, as well as violations of other laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, seeking injunctive or other relief.Recently, the Company received afavorable outcome

Center San Francisco (\u201cILRC\u201d) v.

opinion, is likely tohave  a  material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations;  however,  results  of  litigation  and  claims  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  legalproceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.For example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating toalleged  sexual  assault  or  harassment

these and other plaintiffs are currently pending.Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation canhave an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company\u2019s history of net losses since its inception.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.

Net Loss Per ShareBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject  to repurchase.  The diluted  net loss per  share  is computed  by giving  effect  to all  potentially  dilutive  common  stock equivalents  outstanding  for  the period.

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reportingand the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Our management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\u2019s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and ProceduresOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrol over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.None.Item 9C.

(including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents,and all successors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after theAgreement terminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individualbasis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and Iagree that the arbitrator's award will be final and binding on both parties.This  Arbitration  Agreement  is  intended  to  be  broadly  interpreted.  The  types  of  disputes  and  claims  covered  by  this  Arbitration  Agreement(referred  to  below  as  \u201cClaims\u201d)  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  disputes  over  rights  provided  by  federal,  state,  or  local  statutes,  regulations,ordinances, and common law; claims related to salary, overtime, bonuses, vacation, paid time off, wages, meal and rest breaks, and any otherform  of  compensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional  distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  theimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination and unlawful harassment based on anyprotected  classification,  including  claims  under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and any state employment statutes, such as the California FairEmployment & Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.2.Disputes Excluded From ArbitrationThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers\u2019  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment benefits.

The arbitrator, in his or her sole discretion, may permit any discovery necessary to allow either party to have a fair opportunity to pursuethat party\u2019s claims and defenses.6.Paying For The ArbitrationThe AAA\u2019s rules will govern the amount and allocation of fees for the arbitration, subject to the provisions of this section. Lyft will pay any coststhat are unique to the arbitration process, including fees for the arbitrator\u2019s time and use of an arbitration forum. I will pay any costs that I amrequired to pay under the AAA rules that would be imposed on me in a judicial forum, but in no event shall the AAA filing fee that I amresponsible for paying exceed the filing fees that I would have paid if I had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction.
